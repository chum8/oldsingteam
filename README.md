# Purpose
This first version of the SingTeam website was actually considerably more complex than the final version.  Among additional complexities was a header bar that auto formatted the resulting scores of competitions between singing teams.  Some of these extra features made the design unnecessarily bulky and I trimmed them out in the later, simplified live version.
